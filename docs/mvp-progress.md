# MVP milestone progress

Snapshot: 2026-10-15. This records the local implementation, verification and remaining work for the
[open MVP milestone](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/milestone/1). A passing focused test is not a claim that the
whole milestone, platform suite or release has passed. No issue was closed, release published or tag pushed.

## Issue status

| Issue | Local result | What remains |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [#219 Slow Windows debugger startup](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/219) | `93737dc` fixes the reproduced false five-second timeout for a live runtime and startup cancellation. Integration then exposed a cancellation-response/shutdown ordering race, fixed in `04b7d865`: the configuration lock covers writing success/error responses before disconnect can close the transport, preserving success-only continuation behavior. Both deterministic old-order controls fail; the fixed RC1 run passed 34 focused tests plus 10/10 repetitions of the original cancellation case. | The original CI incident's late-versus-lost callback cause still needs a trace under the failing runner conditions. Final combined validation is recorded below. |
| [#218 WPF generated-file contention](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/218) | Investigated, no speculative source fix. The WPF `WindowsOnlyProjectsTests` regression passed on Windows x64 with RC1. | Design-time WPF compilation can perform real `MarkupCompile` writes to the same `*.g.cs` files. `FileTextLoader` read sharing was ruled out; the actual competing holder and a deterministic failing overlap were not captured. Needs that evidence before choosing cross-process coordination. |
| [#217 MAUI template inventory](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/217) | Fixed in `d94d4af`. The three template-family tests passed with MAUI absent. Installing a temporary MAUI-tagged template into the test's own hive made the exact inventory regression exercise its positive branch and pass; the template was then removed. | The current GitHub Windows runner's actual inventory was not observed locally. |
| [#216 Dialog answer order](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/216) | Shared footer ordering now puts competing answers before Cancel on Windows/Linux and the default last on macOS. Thirteen focused Windows tests passed; dark/light scale-2 screenshots were reviewed. | Execute on macOS/Linux; the local Windows pass does not establish their native behavior. |
| [#215 Cross-platform locked restore](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/215) | Fixed in `7ca9d31`: WPF inspector inherits the shared six-RID list, and its lock file records all six. Forced locked restores passed for every RID. Full self-contained ReadyToRun App restore graphs passed for `osx-arm64`, `osx-x64` and `linux-x64` under RC1. | The actual macOS disk-image/Linux packaging jobs and final release dry run still need to pass on their platform runners. |
| [#214 Await-step/return-watch race](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/214) | Diagnostics added in `3a1ef55`; no race fix claimed. The original await scenario passed 100/100 launches; a return-value boundary probe also passed. Final step/async-step/synthetic-value regressions passed 14/14. | A complete failing engine trace or deterministic other-frame return-watch/completion interleaving is still missing. The 100 clean runs did not exercise that interleaving. |
| [#213 Whole-UI check](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/213) | Partial. Fixed the footer-left option (`331540a`), shared plain-button fill/border (`30d3965`), half-screen minimum/toolbar (`2aab912`), and Welcome heading wrapping (`cd62e96`). Both-theme dialog checks passed; title-bar/command-line checks passed 33 with one macOS-only skip on Windows; the strengthened minimum-width Welcome check passed 1/1 after wrapping. See the screenshot inventory below. | The complete window/dialog/popup/menu/tool-window/settings inventory in both themes, Rider comparison, shared tab/scrollbar/focus/menu checks and simultaneous side-pane collapse behavior are unfinished. |
| [#211 Final MCP pass](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/211) | Audited the existing 65 tools and tests; concrete gaps listed below. | Remaining implementation and per-feature SDK-client tests. The owner requires this final pass after other MVP work; no completed final pass is claimed. |
| [#208 Editor/server line-break drift](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/208) | Existing `LspDocument.Unsplit` fix confirmed; two line-break regressions passed. No further change needed from the local evidence. | Full Windows/Linux/macOS CI runs must establish that the intermittent full-run drift is gone. |
| [#206 CI shards](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/206) | `8048b8e` uses three macOS test shards beside two disk-image jobs, fitting the known five-runner limit. Windows/Linux retain four. Static matrix expansion yields 11 test jobs; all 98 measured classes per system are dealt exactly once. Existing real-suite discovery/result coverage checks still use each system's shard count. | Observe a successful CI run below 25 minutes; class-time estimates are not observed job/wall times. |
| [#57 Linux packaging/install](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/57) | Existing package script, launcher, user/system install/uninstall, Linux instructions, CI smoke jobs and both release architectures were inspected. Shell syntax checks passed. #215 removes the known locked-restore blocker. | Build/check both tarballs and run the Ubuntu desktop build/run/debug/profile/terminal acceptance checks and complete Linux CI suite. This Windows host cannot establish those results. |
| [#56 Release workflow](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/56) | Existing workflow covers tests, six RIDs, fixed asset names, version/feed checks, signing hooks, checksums, tag notes and a non-publishing dry run. Packaging/release shell syntax checks passed. | The owner's required order is other MVP work and green three-system CI, then #211, then #55, then the final dry run, then an owner-chosen tag. The final dry run and tag were not performed out of sequence. Native signing/notarization was not exercised. |
| [#55 Website/README refresh](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/55) | Deferred as the owner explicitly requires this last, after the feature/MCP passes. Existing site, README and comments were inspected. | Commit a repeatable sample and screenshot command; retake all required views in both themes; revise the whole site/README/share card against the finished feature set. The `www` redirect needs the owner's Cloudflare dashboard because the deploy token cannot write redirect rules. |
| [#33 Hot Reload](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/33) | Existing managed-code implementation passed all 8 `HotReloadTests` and 15 `HotReloadEditsTests` on Windows x64. | XAML Hot Reload remains software implementation work: `.axaml`/`.xaml` edits are not tracked; inspector protocol v5 has no XAML-update operation; neither inspector updates matching live instances/resources/templates/namescopes/code-behind. Run under `dotnet watch` currently omits the inspector. UI-thread/paused-app coordination and end-to-end framework tests are also needed. |
| [#19 Data breakpoints](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/19) | Existing Windows x64 implementation and Variables/Breakpoints UI verified by all four data-breakpoint tests, none skipped. | Current engine/runtime availability is explicitly Windows x64. macOS/ARM support was neither implemented nor verified in this pass. |
| [#1 Windows verification](https://github.com/Zaneris/passenger/issues/1) | Existing CET teardown protection runs a paused thread off exception/single-step dispatch before detach; its attach/detach regression passed. The combined data-breakpoint/Hot Reload/CET audit passed 28/28 on Windows x64. | Full Windows x64/ARM64 suite and native interactive build/run/debug/profile acceptance are not established by these focused headless tests. No Windows ARM64 hardware was available. |

## CI scheduling evidence

`tools/test-shards.py` still chooses classes by the recorded system times, not by hand, checks the selected lists
against the real full suite before running, and checks exactly one result per test after running. The matrix change
only changes macOS's number of hands; summary coverage reads the count from each shard's metadata.

| System | Shards | Estimated test minutes per shard from `TestTimes.json` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | 3 | 17.75, 17.74, 17.75 |
| Windows | 4 | 15.03, 15.03, 15.03, 15.03 |
| Linux | 4 | 13.03, 13.03, 13.03, 13.03 |

The previous four-shard macOS deal estimated 13.31 minutes each, but one shard waited 13 minutes while CI also
requested two disk-image runners. Three shards plus two image jobs avoid requesting a sixth macOS slot. Build,
discovery, package and queue times are excluded from the table; the issue's observed-under-25-minute acceptance stays open.

## Partial UI audit and captures

The shared footer now keeps Don't ask again at the left of its buttons on the same row, with enough dialog width for
both. Plain buttons read their fill from one theme token and their border from the shared field border; the light
fill is white. The existing dialog inventory runs in both themes and checks rendered content centering, matching
button geometry, answer order, the footer option's position and plain light-button fill/border.

The main window's minimum is now 640 logical pixels. Below 900 pixels the toolbar keeps project/branch dropdowns as
icons, shortens the configuration label, and returns the Build/Profile icons' space to Run/Debug/Stop/Apply Changes
and the window buttons. Build/Profile retain their menu/actions. Above that width a bounded budget shares label
space; widening restores the labels/icons. Configuration identity remains in its tooltip/dropdown and resizing does
not change the selection. A real `dotnet watch` run with long solution/branch/configuration names checks every visible
toolbar button inside the toolbar, with no overlap, at 640, 683, 800, 900, 1024, 1200 and 1400 pixels and back again.
The Welcome screen's project dropdown is exercised at 640 pixels with no solution open; its heading wraps, and the
regression checks every visible Welcome text layout and action button fits its space.

These are the captures inspected at scale 2, under the shipping worktree's ignored `artifacts/ui-audit-213/` folder:

| Capture files | Checked/found |
| --- | --- |
| `open-solution-dark.png`, `open-solution-light.png` | Footer option moved onto the buttons' row; the light capture exposed the remaining grey plain-button fill. |
| `open-solution-narrow-dark.png`, `open-solution-narrow-light.png` | Same footer at the previous 800-pixel main-window minimum; no clipping in either theme. |
| `open-solution-buttons-dark.png`, `open-solution-buttons-light.png` | Shared button token/border fix: plain light buttons are white and bordered; primary/plain geometry and footer baseline remain alike. |
| `half-tile-exploratory-dark.png` | Temporary lower-minimum probe before toolbar fixes: long names clipped toolbar actions and native window controls, establishing why lowering the minimum alone was insufficient. |
| `half-tile-run-dark.png`, `half-tile-run-light.png` | Corrected 683-pixel window during a live run: compact toolbar/native controls fit, editor and Run remain usable. |
| `welcome-minimum-dark.png`, `welcome-minimum-light.png` | Welcome at the new 640-pixel minimum after wrapping its previously clipped heading: title, subtitle, search, action buttons and empty-list text fit in both complete frames. This is a targeted minimum-width check, not the complete UI inventory. |

To reproduce the corrected targeted views after building, from the repository root:

```sh
mkdir -p artifacts/dialog-before artifacts/dialog-after artifacts/ui-audit-213
for theme in dark light; do
    dotnet artifacts/bin/Passenger.App/debug/Passenger.dll artifacts/dialog-before --open artifacts/dialog-after \
        --screenshot artifacts/ui-audit-213/open-solution-buttons-$theme.png --size 800x600 --scale 2 --theme "$theme"
    dotnet artifacts/bin/Passenger.App/debug/Passenger.dll tests/Debuggees/LoopingConsoleApp --file Program.cs \
        --click-name RunButton --wait 2000 --hover 200,600 \
        --screenshot artifacts/ui-audit-213/half-tile-run-$theme.png --size 683x768 --scale 2 --theme "$theme"
    dotnet artifacts/bin/Passenger.App/debug/Passenger.dll \
        --screenshot artifacts/ui-audit-213/welcome-minimum-$theme.png --size 640x768 --scale 2 --theme "$theme"
done
```

`DockHost.Fit` currently shrinks open side panes proportionally and reserves only 25% for the editor. With both sides
open at half-screen width that can leave roughly 150 pixels for the editor. Automatic pane collapse/restoration and
the full Rider comparison remain unimplemented/unverified here; the toolbar regression does not claim to cover them.

## MCP audit: concrete remaining implementation

The current source has 65 `[McpServerTool(...)]` declarations under `src/Passenger.App/Mcp`, counted again on this
snapshot rather than taken from the issue's earlier count. Existing SDK-client tests cover C# code/debugging,
agent connection/approval/cancellation, Git/terminal operations,
and input/screenshots/failed bindings for Avalonia/WPF apps. Existing coverage and missing coverage should stay distinct:

| Area | Existing | Remaining |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language tools | `PassengerTools.Code` routes to `Session.CSharp`; `format` has a separate XAML implementation. | Route diagnostics/navigation/usages/rename/symbols/actions/format through XAML, web/ESLint/Prettier and MSBuild providers with truthful unsupported-operation results and SDK-client tests. |
| App inspection | `app_tree` gives values; both frameworks have app input, screenshots and failed-binding tools. | Return property value sources and applicable/inapplicable style reasons. |
| Breakpoints/debug state | Existing line, XAML-attribute, exception and binding-error set/remove; data/property breakpoint enumeration. | Property-breakpoint set/remove parameters are absent. `DebugSnapshot` has locals/frames/exception, but no live XAML binding values. |
| Hot Reload | An IDE action can request Apply Changes. | A structured tool returning applied edits, rude edits with file/line and restart requirements; XAML support also depends on #33. |
| Profiling | The `profile` result already includes Avalonia frame/layout costs when present. | Final SDK-client coverage for these costs and all remaining release actions/tool windows. Do not reimplement the existing result fields. |
| Preview/action coverage | `ide_actions` is backed by the action registry and general screenshots can see IDE panes. | Complete the requested per-action, per-tool-window, per-language coverage inventory with a tested MCP path or an explicit reason one is unnecessary, including preview behavior. |

## Reproducing focused verification

The shipping restore/UI checks used the installed .NET `11.0.100-rc.1.26425.128`, selected by a scratch `global.json`
with `rollForward: disable`. Other agents' debugger audits used RC2 selected by the repository's `latestFeature`
setting. There was no SDK pin change or unrelated package-lock churn in the committed work.

For each of `osx-arm64`, `osx-x64`, `linux-x64`, the successful full App restore used the publishing graph's properties:

```sh
dotnet msbuild src/Passenger.App/Passenger.App.csproj -t:Restore -p:RestoreLockedMode=true \
    -p:RuntimeIdentifier=osx-arm64 -p:SelfContained=true -p:PublishReadyToRun=true -nodeReuse:false -maxCpuCount:1
```

The inspector-only forced check covered all six RIDs using the same `RuntimeIdentifier` property, with runtime/host
pack downloads suppressed because the inspector is framework-dependent. Its offline-only run disabled NuGet audit;
the full App restore above used approved NuGet access without that suppression.

On this Windows host, this exact invocation selects RC1 directly even though the repository's normal roll-forward
otherwise selects RC2 (`--version` was checked to return `11.0.100-rc.1.26425.128`). It reproduces the focused build/tests:

```powershell
$dotnetExe = 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe'
$rc1Cli = 'C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\11.0.100-rc.1.26425.128\dotnet.dll'
$env:AVALONIA_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT = '1'
$env:DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT = '1'
$env:NUGET_PACKAGES = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE '.nuget/packages'
& $dotnetExe exec $rc1Cli --version
& $dotnetExe exec $rc1Cli build tests/Passenger.Tests --disable-build-servers -p:UseSharedCompilation=false
& $dotnetExe exec $rc1Cli test tests/Passenger.Tests --no-build --filter 'FullyQualifiedName~DialogButtonsTests|FullyQualifiedName~Open_asks_This_Window_or_New_Window_and_Dont_ask_again_makes_the_answer_the_setting_every_window_follows'
& $dotnetExe exec $rc1Cli test tests/Passenger.Tests --no-build --filter 'FullyQualifiedName~TitleBarTests|FullyQualifiedName~CommandLineTests'
```

Set `AVALONIA_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1` as every `just` recipe does. A NuGet cache relocated under the repository caused
the repository's namespace style to apply to third-party `Krafs.Publicizer` generated source; using the normal cache
outside the repository resolved it without suppressing source checks. Sandbox registry/network/MSYS-object restrictions
needed scoped elevated execution. Existing debuggee unused-local warnings are fixtures, not new production warnings.

The initial combined run on source `155a6dd` ran 54 tests: 52 passed, one failed and one macOS-only test skipped on
Windows. That run caught the real #219 response/shutdown ordering race: disconnect succeeded, but a pending
configuration cancellation could be lost as `the connection closed`. The subsequent product fix `04b7d865` keeps the
configuration lock through both success/error response writes and full-path cleanup, with the existing success-only
continuation semantics preserved. Deterministic stalled-write tests fail under the old ordering and pass when fixed;
34 focused tests and 10/10 repetitions of the original cancellation case passed under direct RC1.

Final integrated source `e7370c87ef622f99294b5ed0acfaf9903c92b84f` passed the direct-RC1 locked restore and full solution
build. The build had zero errors and seven expected CS0219 warnings in unchanged intentional debugger fixtures, with
no product/test-source warnings. The post-fix combined run completed in 63 seconds: **56 total, 55 passed, one
macOS-only test skipped on Windows, zero failures**.

The local integration evidence is under `artifacts/milestone-1/integration/`: `post-fix-restore.log`,
`post-fix-build.log`, `post-fix-tests.log` and `results/post-fix-integration.trx`.

Full three-system CI,
native platform acceptance, release dry run, final MCP pass, site refresh and the owner's release/tag decision remain
separate checkpoints.
